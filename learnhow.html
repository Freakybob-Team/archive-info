    <h1>How We Archive</h1>
    <p>Team members and users of Freakybob Team services sometimes archive our sites on <a href="https://web.archive.org">https://web.archive.org.</a></p>
    <p>We also use Git (GitHub, previously Codeberg and Disroot), which saves a commit log that you can go back in and download from.</p>
    <p>We also use <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior">ArchiveTeam Warrior</a> under the name "FreakybobArchives"</p>
    <h1>How Can I Help?</h1>
    <p>You want to help? Great! Archive our websites or software on <a href="https://archive.org">https://archive.org</a>.</p>
    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p>I've heard of <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Main_Page">ArchiveTeam</a>, do you have something like that?</p>
    <p>No, we never have and likely never will.</p>
    <p>Do I need permission?</p>
    <p>No! If you'd like to archive our websites or software, go ahead! Please do <b>NOT</b> archive our Discord server, as Discord would probably be pissed.</p>
